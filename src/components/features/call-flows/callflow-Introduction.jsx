                  Call forwarding is often the most important step of call flow
                  setup. Call Gauge Pro makes it incredibly simple for you to
                  incorporate it in you call flow. Call forwarding lets you to
                  forward the incoming call to any number of your choice, it can
                  be: your sales team, any other specific department, your
                  client or any other destination.

                  You have full control over calls, where you want them to be
                  forwarded and how long they would ring. By default, calls
                  would ring for 20 sec before moving to the next step if not
                  answered, but you can of course customize this delay between
                  10 to 50 sec.
